    <h3 id="headline">Notable Facts About Joanne Rowling: </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Joanne wanted to be a writer from an early age. She wrote her first book around the age of six.
      </li>
      <li>
        She studied for a year in Paris while attending Exeter University. Her strong knowledge of French and Classics were the tools to help her create Harry Potter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Joanne conceived the idea for her Harry Potter books from sitting on a delayed train. From then, in 1990 to 1995, she mapped out all seven books in the series.
      </li>
      <li>
        Joanne was turned down many times when trying to publish her book. But when one literary agent wrote back and asked for more she said it was, "the best letter I had ever received in my life."
      </li>
      <li>
        Because her publisher thought a book by an obvious female would not appeal to the target audience of young boys, Joanne shortened her name to J. K. Rowling (the "K" stands for Kathleen, her paternal grandmother's name).
      </li>
      <li>
        Out of her <strong>seven book series</strong> J. K. Rowling has also published crime novels, had 8 film adaptations made from her book series, further extended the Wizarding World with Fantastic Beasts films, launched a digital company "Pottermore", has received 15+ awards of various types and gave a Harvard commencement speech. Among many other accomplishments.

    "The new writing identity that Rowling has forged for herself is not only utterly unlike that of her fantasy endeavors, but quirkily different from most of the already established confr√®res she is befriending in the crime writing world,"
